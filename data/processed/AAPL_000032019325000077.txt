In addition, we launched the fantastic AirPods Pro 3 and the all-new Apple Watch lineup. When combined with the recently announced MacBook Pro and iPad Pro with the powerhouse M5 chip, we are excited to be sharing our most extraordinary lineup of products as we head into the holiday season.” “Our September quarter results capped off a record fiscal year, with revenue reaching $416 billion, as well as double-digit EPS growth,” said Kevan Parekh, Apple’s CFO. “And thanks to our very high levels of customer satisfaction and loyalty, our installed base of active devices also reached a new all-time high across all product categories and geographic segments.” Apple’s board of directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.26 per share of the Company’s common stock.

RECONCILIATION OF 2024 NON-GAAP TO GAAP RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Unaudited) (In millions, except number of shares, which are reflected in thousands, and per-share amounts) Three Months Ended Twelve Months Ended September 28, 2024 September 28, 2024 As Reported (GAAP) Non-GAAP Adjustments (a) As Adjusted (Non-GAAP) As Reported (GAAP) Non-GAAP Adjustments (a) As Adjusted (Non-GAAP) Income before provision for income taxes $ 29,610 $ — $ 29,610 $ 123,485 $ — $ 123,485 Provision for income taxes 14,874 (10,246) (b) 4,628 29,749 (10,246) (b) 19,503 Net income $ 14,736 $ 10,246 (b) $ 24,982 $ 93,736 $ 10,246 (b) $ 103,982 Diluted earnings per share $ 0.97 $ 0.67 (c) $ 1.64 $ 6.08 $ 0.67 (c) $ 6.75 Shares used in computing diluted earnings per share 15,242,853 — 15,242,853 15,408,095 — 15,408,095 (a) These adjustments reconcile certain of the Company’s GAAP results of operations to its non-GAAP results of operations. The Company believes that the presentation of results excluding the impact of the reversal of the European General Court’s State Aid decision provides meaningful supplemental information to both management and investors that is indicative of the Company’s core operating results and facilitates comparison of operating results across reporting periods. The Company uses these non-GAAP measures when evaluating its financial results as well as for internal planning and forecasting purposes. These non-GAAP measures should not be viewed as a substitute for the Company’s GAAP results. (b) Non-GAAP adjustments to provision for income taxes and net income to reflect the impact of the reversal of the European General Court’s State Aid decision recognized during the fourth quarter of 2024. On September 10, 2024, the European Court of Justice announced that it had set aside the 2020 judgment of the European General Court and confirmed the European Commission’s 2016 State Aid decision. As a result, during the fourth quarter of 2024 the Company recorded a one-time income tax charge of $10.2 billion, net, which represented $15.8 billion payable to Ireland via release of restricted funds held in escrow, partially offset by a U.S. foreign tax credit of $4.8 billion and a decrease in unrecognized tax benefits of $823 million. For additional information, refer to Note 7, “Income Taxes” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of the Company's fiscal 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K. (c) Represents the per-share impact of the non-GAAP adjustments to net income.
